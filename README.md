# Flutter RTMP Live stream Client

[api.video](https://api.video/) is the video infrastructure for product builders. Lightning fast video APIs for integrating, scaling, and managing on-demand & low latency live streaming features in your app.

</documentation_only>-->
## Project description

This module is made for broadcasting RTMP live stream from smartphone camera.

## Getting started

### Installation

In your pubspec.yaml file, add the following:

```yaml
dependencies:
  apivideo_live_stream: ^1.1.3
```

In your dart file, import the package:

```dart 
import 'package:apivideo_live_stream/apivideo_live_stream.dart';
```

### Permissions

To be able to broadcast, you must:

1) On Android: ask for internet, camera and microphone permissions:

```xml

<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
</manifest>
```

The library will require android.permission.CAMERA and android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO at runtime.

2) On iOS: update the Info.plist with a usage description for camera and microphone

```xml

<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key><string>Your own description of the purpose</string>

<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key><string>Your own description of the purpose</string>
```

### Code sample

1. Creates a live stream controller

```dart

final ApiVideoLiveStreamController _controller = ApiVideoLiveStreamController(
    initialAudioConfig: AudioConfig(), initialVideoConfig: VideoConfig.withDefaultBitrate());
```

2. Initializes the live stream controller

```dart
await _controller.initialize();
```

3. Adds a CameraPreview widget as a child of your view

Ensure that _controller.create() has been finished before creating the CameraPreview widget.

```dart
child: ApiVideoCameraPreview(controller: _controller),
```

4. Starts a live stream

```dart
_controller.startStreaming("YOUR_STREAM_KEY");
```

5. Stops streaming and preview

```dart
_controller.stop();
```

#### Manage application lifecycle

On the application side, you must manage application lifecycle:

```dart
@override
void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
  if (state == AppLifecycleState.inactive) {
    _controller.stop();
  } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
    _controller.startPreview();
  }
}
```
